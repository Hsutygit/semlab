SEM1D and SEM2D apply the Spectral Element Method
to solve the 1D/2D scalar wave equation, 
with stress free or absorbing boundary conditions,
zero initial conditions
and a time dependent point source or incident wave.

These scripts are intended for tutorial purposes.

2. ABOUT THE METHOD
-------------------

SPACE DISCRETIZATION is performed via the 
Spectral Element Method (Patera, 1984).
Some background about the SEM by can be found in
sections 2.1 to 2.3 of www.mate.tue.nl/people/vosse/docs/vosse96b.pdf .
The discretization of the 1D wave equation is similar to the
treatment of the 1D Helmholtz equation in section 2.3.2.
The SEM can be seen as a domain decomposition 
version of a Spectral Method
or as a high order version of the Finite Element Method.
It inherits from its parent methods the accuracy (spectral 
convergence) and the geometrical flexibility, respectively.
The domain is decomposed in elements and each element 
is provided with a spectral subgrid of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) nodes.
The polynomial order P of the spatial approximation fixes 
the number of GLL nodes (NGLL=P+1).
SEM translates the weak form of the wave equation 
into an algebraic system (like in FEM)
  M*a = -K*d + f
where the mass matrix M is diagonal by construction
(mass lumping is not required).
This property is achieved by taking the same nodes for 
the interpolation and for the quadrature (Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre).
In high dimensions a tensorial nodal basis is used.
Relevant references are given in section 5. 

TIME DISCRETIZATION of the system of equations M*a = -K*d +f
is usually (in structural dynamics) performed via explicit 
second-order schemes like Newmark or leap-frog.
These are illustrated here, as well as a 4th-order explicit scheme
and a 2d-order implicit scheme.


3. SETTING SIMULATION PARAMETERS
--------------------------------

To set the parameters of the simulation 
the following criteria must be understood:

RESOLUTION (dispersion) is determined by the number 
of GLL nodes per shortest wavelength. 
See figure sem1d_hp_freq.ps in this directory.
The shortest wavelength to be resolved is given by
the wave velocity, vs=sqrt(mu/rho), divided by
the highest frequency in the source time function, fmax. 
For a Ricker wavelet fmax is approximatively 2.5 times 
the fundamental frequency f0. 
When the mesh is too coarse for a given fmax spurious oscillations appear.
Resolution is controlled by the mesh density and
can be improved by increasing either the number of elemenets (NEL)
or the number of GLL nodes (NGLL).

STABILITY in explicit time schemes is determined by 
the CFL number = vs*dt/min(dx),
the ratio of the distance travelled by a wave in one timestep
to the shortest GLL node spacing.
CFL must be smaller than a critical value that depends on the
time scheme. For centered differences it is close to 0.85 in 1D.
For 2D divide it by sqrt(2).
Note that the spacing of the GLL nodes is not uniform and
that as NGLL increases they cluster at the boundary of the elements.
That's why we keep a moderate value NGLL<=10.



4. A TUTORIAL TOUR
------------------

To get started with the implementation of SEM you should begin
by having a look at sem1d.m (including the comments therein).
This is the most basic script provided here, it solves the 1D wave equation.

In sem1d_abso.m we add absorbing boundaries and an incident wavefield.
