*Spectral Element Method for wave propagation and rupture dynamics in Matlab.*

The Spectral Element Method combines the accuracy of spectral methods with the geometrical flexibility of finite elements. It is widely used in computational fluid dynamics and has been succesfully applied to problems in seismology ranging from regional to global scale wave propagation and earthquake dynamics. 

SEMLAB is intended for tutorial purposes. Problems solved include wave propagation and dynamic earthquake rupture in 1D and 2D anti-plane. For production codes in Fortran/MPI, see [SEM2DPACK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sem2d/) or [SPECFEM3D](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/).

The SEMLAB releases ae hosted also in the [Matlab File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6154-semlab).
